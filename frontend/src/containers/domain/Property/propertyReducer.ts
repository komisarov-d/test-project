					'â€œThe hotel is located in the very center of Lviv, it is very convenient to get to all the sights, you can walk from the train station, there is a trolleybus stop to the airport. Very cozy, the hotel is new and very clean. Polite staff. I liked the idea of â€‹â€‹a capsule, which is why I booked this hotel. An interesting idea, inside the capsule resembles half a compartment of a train, two beds, there is a table, hangers, everything you need for a good rest before departure. Since I needed to wake up very early, the most important factor for me was the silence and the capsule fully met my expectations. Excellent sound insulation, you can sleep peacefully at least in the afternoon. There is also a kitchen where you can prepare something for yourself, drinking water, tea and coffee. Highly recommend! The most cozy hotel that I stayed in Lviv) "',
